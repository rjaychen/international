This is a application made at HackDuke to sort through lectures transcripts/paragraphs. It filters the keywords of the input and returns the most relavent educational resources, filtered through a pool of open course ware websites using google custom search engines. In order to run locally on a computer, run main.py, and input the lecture audio/transcript into the website https://ryanjchen.wixsite.com/noto. 

A local server must be set up to run the algorithm currently, and new API keys can be generated at the link below for use with the custom search engine:
